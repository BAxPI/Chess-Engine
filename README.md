# BAxPI-c
## About the Project
The **BAxPI-c** chess engine is made following the amazing youtube series ["Bitboard CHESS ENGINE in C" ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmN0neTso3Jxh8ZIylk74JpwfiWNI76Cs) by Chess Programming and the [Chess Programming Wiki Page](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page).

The project was made in order to study and practice C++ as it was the first program I've written in C++. It is not a copy of the series as I tried to do things on my own, and improve where I could, but it takes great inspiration and in parts (especially in the beggining) it is a mere translation from C to C++.

For any suggestion, correction or improvement feel free to send me a message, BAxPI.
